<h2>Description</h2>
Like a normal campaign but opposite.<br/>
<br/>
For example if a product is meant to launch on the 28th of June you can automatically send emails 2 weeks before it's launch.<br/>
<br/>
In this case you would set the campaign direction to resverse and the start date to the 14th (launch date - 14days)<br/>
<br/>
If you wanted a second email to send 10 days before the product launch you can set a second activity for 4 days after the first, which will cause it to run on the 18th<br/>
