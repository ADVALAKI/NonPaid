<h2>Description</h2>
Trigger campaign activities on advanced conditions, i.e. 1 hour after previous activity email as opened<br/>
This also works in reverse, e.g. if email not opened after 7 days send follow up email<br/>
Or forked logic such as if email was clicked within 5 days trigger activity 7 otherwise trigger activity 8<br/>
